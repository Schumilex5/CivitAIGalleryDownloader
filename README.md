Hi. This was made for personal use, it may have bugs I don't know about, but it works for me and does the things i want, if you meet errors you can let me know tho.

### Features:
- Download images and mp4 files from a CivitAI model gallery
  
### installation:
* Download the extension folder
* Go to -> chrome://extensions/
* Click "Load unpacked extension"
* Navigate inside the extension folder when asked for location

### Usage:
- Click the extension icon when on a civitai model page
- You may click restart if download fails multiple times


## Known Bugs:
- When maximum parallel downloads are set higher than 3 not all images may be downloaded, leave it on default for now
