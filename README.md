### installation:
* Download the extension folder
* Go to -> chrome://extensions/
* Click "Load unpacked extension"
* Navigate inside the extension folder when asked for location
###### You can pin the extension now and start it by clicking on it.

## Known Bugs:
- Sometimes you need to click the restart button if the download is stuck, if it happenes too much or stops progressing disabling then re-enabling the extension should fix it
- I met one gallery among hundreds where images were hosted elsewhere and I got a header error, Ill think about patching it if I encounter it again
